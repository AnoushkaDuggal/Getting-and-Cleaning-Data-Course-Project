# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This project is the final submission for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins University. Its purpose is to showcase the ability to gather, process, and clean a dataset for analysis.

**Contents of This Repository**

This repository contains 4 key files:

run_analysis.R: The R script that executes data processing steps.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

CodeBook.md: A codebook that details the dataset, variables, and transformations applied.

tidyData.txt: The final, cleaned dataset.

**Project Requirements**

This project is evaluated based on the following criteria:

Submission of a tidy dataset.

Inclusion of required scripts in the GitHub repository.

A codebook that provides an updated description of the dataset, including variables, summaries, and units.

A clear and detailed README file explaining the analysis files.

Assurance that the work submitted is original and completed by the student.

**Project Focus**

Processing Wearable Computing Data

The project explores data gathered from wearable computing devicesâ€”a rapidly growing field in data science. Companies such as Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone are advancing wearable technology through innovative algorithms. This dataset, provided via the course website, contains information recorded by accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.
